# internship_tictactoe
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java using Swing for the graphical user interface. The game allows two players to take turns placing their marks (X and O) on a 3x3 grid, automatically checking for win conditions or a draw after every move. It’s designed for basic demonstration purposes, to help beginners understand Java GUI programming and event handling. To run it, simply clone the repository, compile TicTacToe.java using javac, and run the compiled program with java TicTacToe. The game is a fun and interactive way to see Java in action, and you’re welcome to fork the project and experiment with adding new features!
